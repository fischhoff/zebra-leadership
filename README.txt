This github folder contains the following: 

1) A set of scripts with the .R extension. R is an open-source, freely available statistical software available for download at: http://www.r-project.org/. The R scripts allow the user to perform the same analyses as in the manuscript, including computing test statistics describing observed leadership patterns, and generating null distributions using randomization procedures.

2) ?Makefile?, which is a guide to the series of commands to run, to perform the analyses. You can read this using a text reader, like Notepad or Vim. 

3) ?lead.R.env?, which is an R ?environment? file, containing the original leadership data.

4) leadership_in_plains_zebra_03_04_2012_v3.pdf. This is a working draft of a paper describing the methods and results.
